# Tomori

A Mix-Space theme built with Next

The name comes from *「BanG Dream! It's MyGO!!!!!」* and specifically from the lead singer of the band *「MyGO!!!!!」*, 高松（たかまつ Takamatsu） 燈（ともり Tomori）.

Why not *Tomorin*? Because during the development, the developer's avatar was not ANON, so it couldn’t be named Tomorin.
